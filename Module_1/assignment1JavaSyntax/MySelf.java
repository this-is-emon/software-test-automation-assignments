Assignment_1_Writing_firstCode_Java:
Step 1: Create a Project name "AssignmentYourName", For example, AssignmentAlex.

Step 2: Create a package name "assignment1JavaSyntax" inside the src file of the project.

Step 3: Create a class name "MySelf" (Please don't select the main method while creating a Class). 
		Can you get the main method by a shortcut? If yes, please do so.

Step 4: Print Your name and address in different lines inside the main method. 
		You can use the knowledge how to copy a line to do so [try to follow how to copy and paste a line in IDE by keyboard command]. 
		Can you see the print outcome in the console?

Step 5: Now, Use multiple line comments between package and Class.
 		Write there the naming convention of Project, package, and Class. (Please get the help of class notes).

Step 6: Use also single-line comments just before the main method and 
		write about what you know about the main method (please get the help of class notes).

Step 7: Organize the code [Put your cursor in the Editor, and type shift + ctrl/Command + F to organize the code].

Step 8: Now Copy the code and paste it below as your answer.
